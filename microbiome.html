        <h4>Microbiomes Practical</h4><br>
        <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by excessive growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased
           vaginal discharge that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color and burning with urination may
           occur, as well as itching. However, in some cases there may be no symptoms. Having BV can double the risk of infection by a number
           of other sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.</p>
        <p>BV is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. This change presents itself as a change in the
           most common type of bacteria in the vaginal microbiome and a hundred to thousand-fold increase in total numbers of bacteria present.</p>
        <p>For this practical we are considering 6 samples of vaginal swab that were taken at the polyclinic by a GP in a setting of high
          transmission of HIV. DNA was extracted from the swabs and amplified using primers specific for the Region V1 and V2 of the 16S
          rRNA gene of the bacteria (positions: 1148bp – 5716bp). These samples were then sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina machine producing
          PAIRED END data of 300 bp. The 6 pairs of files generated are found in the <b>metagenomics/fastq</b> folder. The patients’
          phenotype was determined by the doctors at the time of the sample collection giving the following results:</p>

        <h4>Analysing the microbiome samples with <i>mothur</i></h4>
        <p>The software we will use for analysing the samples is mothur which was created by Dr. Patrick Schloss
           and his software development team in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at The University of
           Michigan. Its objective was to create a single piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the
           bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology community.</p>
        <p>In order to open mothur, open a new terminal and navigate to the folder ~/data/metagenomics.</p>
        <pre><code>cd ~/data/metagenomics</pre></code>
        <p>FOr this practical we will be using an old version of python so in order to use it run the commnad:</p>
        <pre><code>source activate mothur_env</pre></code>
        <p>Now, to start the software type in the command:</p>
        <pre><code>mothur</pre></code>
        <p>You should see a screen like this:</p>
         <div class="text-center"><img src="img/microbiome_1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="Microbiome_1"></div>
         <br>
      <p>So far so good, now to initiate the analysis we only need a database, to which we will map
        our dataset (it has been provided to you in the folder database under the name
        silva.bacteria.fasta, here you can find more information about the database
        <a href="https://www.arb-silva.de/" target="_blank">https://www.arb-silva.de/</a>). The second thing is the fastq files (they are stored
        in fastq folder) and finally we need a file that links the files together,
        called in this case BV.files.</p>
      <p>To check how this file looks like type in:</p>
      <pre><code>system(cat BV.files)</pre></code>
      <p><b>Note that in mothur the commands that are not specifically developed in the framework
        will need to be typed under the command <i>system()</i>.</b></p>
      <p>Once we are ready let us start with the analysis, the first step will be to reconstruct
        the reads by assembling the paired reads into contigs. In this step we are assembling the
        reads that should overlap due to the design of our primers. In the following example,
        check how the reads should map against a contig:</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_2_1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
        <p>To generate these contigs we run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>make.contigs(file=BV.files, processors=1)</pre></code>
        <p>Note that we are using 4 processors to speed things up, and it will take at most 5-10
          minutes. Once finished you will see a list of the samples with the amount of reads in
          each sample:</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6"><div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>
            Group count:
            BB_1		56715
            BB_2		53890
            BB_3		61157
            BB_4		72766
            BB_5		2193
            BB_6		989

            Total of all groups is 247710</samp>
          </div></div>
          <div class="col-sm-6 text-center">
            <div class="alert alert-warning">
          What can you infer from the number of groups (contigs) in each sample breakdown? Are
          samples 5 and 6 directly comparable to the rest of the samples? Do you think this will
          have an impact on the representativeness of the microbial community in these samples?
        </div>
        <p><b>NOTE: The 247710 number refers to the number of total conitgs.</b></p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <p>In the output you will also have a list of the output files. You can check what they look
          like using the following commands:</p>
        <pre><code>system(head BV.trim.contigs.fasta)</pre></code>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div><br>
        <p>The BV.trim.contigs.qual will store all the sequence reads for all the samples.</p>
        <pre><code>system(head BV.trim.contigs.qual)</pre></code>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_4.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div><br>
        <p>The BV.trim.contigs.qual stores the quality of the bases called in each contig.</p>
        <pre><code>system(head BV.contigs.report)</pre></code>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div><br>
        <p>The BV.contigs.report stores the summary of the contig quality and the file BV.contigs.groups
          links the individual reads with the different samples.</p>
        <p>A good way to summarize the overall quality of the reads is by running the command:</p>
        <pre><code>summary.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.fasta)</pre></code>
        <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>

  <p>Interestingly, the longest read in the dataset is 600 bp. Be suspicious of this. Recall that
    the reads are supposed to be 300 bp each. This read clearly did not assemble well (or at all).
     Also note that at least 2.5% of our sequences had some ambiguous base calls and that the
     maximum homopolymer, the same base repeated over (i.e AAAAAAAA is a homopolymer of 8 Adenine)
      is 282 bp in a row, these sequences are normally errors created in the sequencing process.
      We will take care of these issues in the next step when we run screen.seqs.</p>
      <pre><code>screen.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.fasta, group=BV.contigs.groups, summary=BV.trim.contigs.summary, maxambig=0, maxlength=340, maxhomop=6)</pre></code>
    <p>With this command we are telling mothur to select only the reads with a <b>maximum length
      of 340 bp</b>, with a number of <b>maximum homopolymers of 6</b> and with <b>0 ambiguous
        calls</b>.</p>
      <p>We anticipate that many of our sequences are duplicates of each other because of the
        amplification. Because it is computationally wasteful to align the same thing a million
        times, we'll analyse only the unique sequences and infer the result to the rest using the
        unique.seqs command:</p>
        <pre><code>unique.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.fasta)</pre></code>
        <p>If two sequences have the same identical sequence, then they are considered duplicates
          and will get merged. In the screen output there are two columns - the first is the number
          of sequences characterized and the second is the number of unique sequences remaining. So
          after running <i>unique.seqs</i><b> the number of sequences reduces from 204,240 to 13,611</b>.
          This will make the analysis easier and faster.</p>
        <p>The next command will rename the sequences to make the processing faster and generate a
          file called <i>BV.trim.contigs.good.count_table</i>. In subsequent commands we will use it by
          applying the count option:</p>
        <pre><code>count.seqs(name=BV.trim.contigs.good.names, group=BV.contigs.good.groups)</pre></code>
        <p>Now that our reads are ordered and clean is the time to align our reads to the reference
          database and check what we have in there.</p>
        <pre><code>align.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.fasta, reference=database/silva.bacteria.fasta, flip=T)
summary.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.align, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.count_table)</pre></code>
        <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>
          Start	End	NBases	Ambigs	Polymer	NumSeqs
Minimum:	<b>1044	6330</b>	275	0	3	1

</samp></div>
        <p>So what does this mean? You will see that the bulk of the sequences start at position
          1044 and end at position 6333. Some sequences start at position 1044 and end at 6330
          or 6443. These deviants from the mode positions are likely due to an insertion or
          deletion at the terminal ends of the alignments. Sometimes you will see sequences that
          start and end at the same position indicating a very poor alignment, which is generally
          due to non-specific amplification. To make sure that everything overlaps the same region
          we will re-run <i>screen.seqs</i> to obtain sequences that start at or before position 1148
          and end at or after position 5716.</p>
          <pre><code>screen.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.align, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.count_table, summary=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.summary, start=1148, end=5716, maxhomop=6)</pre></code>
          <p>Now we know our sequences overlap the same alignment coordinates, we want to make
            sure they only overlap that region. So we will filter the sequences to remove the
            overhangs at both ends. In addition, there are many columns in the alignment that
            only contain gap characters (i.e. "-"). These can be pulled out without losing any
            information. We will do all this with <i>filter.seqs</i>:</p>
            <pre><code>filter.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.align, vertical=T, trump=.)</pre></code>
            <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>Length of filtered alignment: 570
Number of columns removed: 49430
Length of the original alignment: 50000
Number of sequences used to construct filter: 13610</samp></div>
        <p>This means that our initial alignment was 50000 columns wide and that we were able to
          remove 49430 terminal gap characters using <i>trump=.</i> and vertical gap characters using
          <i>vertical=T</i>. The final alignment length is 570 columns. Because we have perhaps created
          some redundancy across our sequences by trimming the ends, we can re-run <i>unique.seqs</i>:</p>
          <pre><code>unique.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.fasta, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.good.count_table)</pre></code>
          <p>This identified 3182 duplicate sequences that we have now merged with previous unique
            sequences. The next thing we want to do to further de-noise our sequences is to pre-cluster
            the sequences using the pre.cluster command allowing for up to 3 differences between
            sequences. This command will split the sequences by group and then sort them by abundance
            and go from most abundant to least and identify sequences that are within 2 nt of each other.
            If they are then they get merged. We generally favour allowing 1 difference for every 100 bp
            of sequence:</p>
            <pre><code>pre.cluster(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.fasta, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.count_table, diffs=3)</pre></code>
            <p>At this point we have removed as much sequencing error as we can and it is time to turn
              our attention to removing chimeras(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044863/"
              target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044863/</a>). We will do this using the
              <i>UCHIME</i> algorithm that is called within <i>mothur</i> using the <i>chimera.uchime</i>
               command. Again, this command will split the data by sample and check for chimeras. Our
               preferred way of doing this is to use the abundant sequences as our reference. In addition,
               if a sequence is flagged as chimeric in one sample, the default <i>dereplicate=F</i> is to
               remove it from all samples. We have found that this is a bit aggressive since we have seen
               rare sequences get flagged as chimeric when they're the most abundant sequence in another
               sample. This is how we do it:</p>
               <pre><code>chimera.uchime(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.fasta, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.count_table, dereplicate=T)</pre></code>
               <p>Running <i>chimera.uchime</i> with the count file will remove the chimeric sequences from that
                 file. But we still need to remove those sequences from the fasta file. We do this using
                 <i>remove.seqs</i>:</p>
               <pre><code>remove.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.fasta, accnos=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.uchime.accnos)</pre></code>
               <p>You should see the following line:</p>
               <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>Removed 785 sequences from your fasta file.</samp></div>
               <p>Let us see what we have left:</p>
               <pre><code>summary.seqs(fasta=current, count=current)</pre></code>

              reasonable number of sequences to be flagged as chimeric (it can go up to around
              10%).</p>
            <p>As a final quality control step, we need to see if there are any "undesirables"
              in our dataset. Sometimes when we pick a primer set they will amplify other stuff
              that gets to this point in the pipeline such as 18S rRNA gene fragments or 16S
              rRNA from <i>Archaea</i>, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. There is also just the random
              stuff that we want to get remove (we will provide you with the list, no worries).</p>
            <p>Let us go ahead and classify those sequences using the Bayesian classifier
                with the <i>classify.seqs</i> command:</p>

              <h4>OTU Classification</h4><br>
              <p>Now we are going to cluster the sequences into OTUs.</p>
              <p><b>So what is an OTU?</b></p>
              <p>OTU's are used to categorize bacteria based on sequence similarity. In 16S metagenomics
                approaches, OTUs are clusters of similar sequence variants of the 16S rDNA marker gene
                sequence. Each of these cluster is intended to represent a taxonomic unit of a bacteria
                species or genus depending on the sequence similarity threshold. Typically, OTU cluster
                are defined by a 97% identity threshold of the 16S gene sequence variants, but also the
                use of 99% identity is suggested for species separation.</p>
                <p>OTU classification resolution depends on the 16S approach which has some limits in
                  distinguishing at the species level, for example, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and
                  <i>Shigella spp.</i> share almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequences.</p>
                  <p>To do the classification we will use <i>dist.seqs</i>:</p>
              <pre><code>dist.seqs(fasta=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.fasta, cutoff=0.20)</pre></code>
              <pre><code>cluster(column=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.dist, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.uchime.pick.pick.count_table)</pre></code>
              <p>Do not worry if you see a lot of 0's populating your screen this is normal, once finished we want
                 to know how many sequences are in each OTU from each group, and we can do this using the
                 <i>make.shared</i> command. Here we tell mothur that we are really only interested in the
                 0.03 cut-off level.</p>
              <pre><code>make.shared(list=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.list, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.uchime.pick.pick.count_table, label=0.03)</pre></code>
              <p>Finally we will classify the OTU's obtained based on our database taxonomy.</p>
              <pre><code>classify.otu(list=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.list, count=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.denovo.uchime.pick.pick.count_table, taxonomy=BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.silva.wang.pick.taxonomy, label=0.03)</pre></code>
              <p>To see the output like the one below type:</p>
              <pre><code>system(head BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.0.03.cons.taxonomy)</pre></code>
              <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_7.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
              <br>
              <p>This is telling you that Otu001 was observed 82356 times in your samples and that
                all of the sequences (100%) were classified as being members of the
                <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Assessing alpha diversity</h4><br>
                <p>To make this part is easier, rename the shared file as follows:</p>
                <pre><code>system(cp BV.trim.contigs.good.unique.good.filter.unique.precluster.pick.pick.opti_mcc.shared BV.an.shared)</pre></code>
                <p>Then run the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>rarefaction.single(shared=BV.an.shared, calc=sobs, freq=100)</pre></code>
                <p>This will produce the file <i>BV.an.groups.rarefaction</i>. that includes the rarefaction curves for the 6
                 samples. To plot this rarefaction curves we will use the statistical software <i>R</i>. Open a new
                 command line and navigate to <i>~/data/metagenomics/</i> and type <i>R</i>.</p>
                 <pre><code>cd ~/data/metagenomics/
R</pre></code>
                <p><b>This will start <i>R</i> then copy the following scripts to plot the graphics.</b></p>
                <pre><code>data<-read.table("~/data/metagenomics/BV.an.groups.rarefaction",sep="\t",header=T)
data_all<-c(data$X0.03.BB_1,data$X0.03.BB_2,data$X0.03.BB_3,data$X0.03.BB_4,data$X0.03.BB_5,data$X0.03.BB_6)
max_all<-max(data_all,na.rm=TRUE)

                <p>The output should look like this:</p>
                <div class="text-center"><img src="img/Microbiome_8.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
                <br>
                <p><b>Rarefaction</b> is a technique to assess species richness from the results of sampling.
                  Rarefaction allows the calculation of species richness for a given number of individual
                  samples, based on the construction of so-called rarefaction curves. This curve is a plot
                  of the number of species as a function of the number of samples. On the left, the steep
                  slope indicates that a large fraction of the species diversity remains to be discovered.
                  If the curve becomes flatter to the right, a reasonable number of individual samples
                  have been taken: more intensive sampling is likely to yield only few additional species.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning">Knowing this, what are your conclusions about sample BB_5 and
                  BB_6? Also, what other important information can be spotted between the BV positive samples
                  and the Healthy samples?
